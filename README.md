# BowlingGame
I apologize for the lack of UI (or really any response)
The original plan was to lay out a board like one at an alley, where the cumulative score for the individual frame is shown (hence why a list of Frame objects was the route taken, so individual frame scores could be better tracked)
I would like to revisit this to create a UI when I have the time.
